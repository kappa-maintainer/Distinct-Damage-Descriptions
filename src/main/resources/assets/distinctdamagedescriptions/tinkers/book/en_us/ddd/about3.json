However in addition to that, the tool gains a bonus to Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning and any other additional types it may have in its damage distribution equal to 30% of the tool's average head durabilities divided by 1000, rounded down to the nearest percent. The takeaway is that extremely durable heads make for better shields!"
