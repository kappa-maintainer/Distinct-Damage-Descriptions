You'll have to balance which damage types you want your armor to be effective against with toughness and durability modifier provided by that specific material in order to get the most out of your armor. Some armor pieces provide immunities! Armor only provides effectiveness and immunities if it's not broken, so keep that in mind! The next pages lists the armor distribution for each material. Good luck out there!",
